# Computer Performance

How the computer revolution has been archieved
- Technology and architecture
- Power wall


Great ideas in computer architecture
- Design for Moore’s Law
- Use abstraction to simplify design
- Make the common case faster
- Performance via parallelism
- Performance vis pipelining
- Performance via prediction
- Hierarchy of memories
- Dependability via redundancy

Relative Performance
- Performance = 1/Execution Time

CPU Clocking

CPU TIME
[사진]()
- Performance improved by
    - Reducing number of clock cycles
    - Increasing clock rate
    - Hardware designer must often trade off clock rate against cycle count
        - E.g., CISC vs. RISC
